Common Issues
Navigation & Routing


Q: My route is not loading or showing incorrect directions

Ensure you have a stable internet connection
Check that location services are enabled: Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services → TruckNav Pro
Verify your truck dimensions are set correctly in Settings
Try restarting the app


Q: Voice guidance is not working

Check voice volume in Settings → Navigation → Voice Volume
Ensure your device volume is turned up
Verify background audio permission is enabled
Check if "Do Not Disturb" mode is active


Q: App says my truck can't use this route

This is normal - TruckNav Pro uses TomTom truck routing to avoid restricted roads
Check your truck height, weight, and hazmat settings in Settings → Truck Specifications
The route may have low bridges, weight restrictions, or hazmat prohibitions
Location & GPS
Q: My location is not accurate or not showing

Enable "Precise Location" for best accuracy: Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services → TruckNav Pro → Precise Location
Ensure you're not in a tunnel, parking garage, or area with poor GPS signal
Try toggling Airplane Mode on/off to reset GPS
Restart your device
